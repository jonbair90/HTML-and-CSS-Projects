			<blockquote cite="https://listproducer.com/2012/01/5-health-benefits-of-list-making/">
			Making a list will make you more organized, productive and efficient.  But did you know that there are actual health benefits to list making too? Yes – it’s true. I’ve spoken with psychologists and surgeons about this topic and they’ve all said the same thing: lists will help you be healthier.  Whether you’re writing down healthful goals or just making grocery lists — the benefits are equal.
